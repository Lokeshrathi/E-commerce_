# E-commerce_

### Motivation-This repository was created to understand various concepts of OOPs using Python Programming Language.

- Created a E-commerce similar working project.
- This Project has various Classes such as Customer,Product, Inventory.

 ### A customer can buy a Product present in the Inventory.
 ### Inventory can be updated as per the number of Items present in it.
 ### Products are defined by the Name and its Price.
 ### After a customer makes a purchase, he/she will be displayed with the Items bought and the total costing of them.
 
 ## Inspiration:
 - I hope this small contirbution might help someone with understanding of concepts like Methods, Classes, Inheritance and other Object Oriented Programming concepts.
